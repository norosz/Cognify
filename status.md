# 🚀 Project Status Board — V2 Alpha

This board tracks the **V2 Alpha** refinement scope (wiring + UX bugfixes + small backend extensions).
Authoritative implementation details live in [implementation.md](implementation.md).

---

## 🎯 V2 Alpha Scope (commitment)

- Quizzes have dedicated pages (detail/stats/history, results, review)
- Quiz submit shows loading + prevents double-submit
- Quiz cards show difficulty (color) + category (AI suggested + user applied)
- Module page refactor with module-level stats and an Exams section
- Module Final Exam:
	- fixed until regenerate
	- tracked via separate `ExamAttempt`
	- current exam pointer: `Module.CurrentFinalExamQuizId`
- Statistics moved to its own page (`/statistics`)
- Notes:
	- show related uploaded + extracted documents (downloadable)
	- images render inline
	- split user vs AI note content (two inputs)
- Review queue behavior matches backend (knowledge-state due items + forgetting risk ordering)
- `includeExams` query param supported on analytics endpoints (default false) and will be wired to a persisted user toggle
- Categories (Module + Quiz):
	- AI suggest is gated by content (module: noteCount + quizCount >= 1; quiz: questionCount >= 3)
	- AI suggest never overwrites current category; user applies via `PUT .../category`
	- AI suggestions + applied categories are stored as history batches (scrollable dropdown on focus)
- Category breakdown analytics (combined modules + quizzes) added to Statistics page
- Final Exam v2:
	- module-scoped and note-less (exams only)
	- questions generated from user-selected module notes
	- friendly “no notes selected” gating with “Include all notes” fix
- Statistics v2:
	- single page with tabs (Practice / Exams)
	- category breakdown defaults to module category
	- quiz-category filters apply to practice only
- Module creation category UX:
	- category is optional; if omitted, AI generates a default category (avoid “Uncategorized”)

## 🧭 Decisions (locked)

- Separate `ExamAttempt` entity/table (not stored in `Attempt`).
- Final Exam is fixed until regenerate; retake creates additional `ExamAttempt` rows.
- `includeExams` param on analytics endpoints; frontend will persist a user toggle and pass it consistently.
- Concept identification via embeddings + topic clustering per module; clusters labeled by AI.
- Module detail layout: Quizzes section appears above Module Stats.
- Category history pagination is cursor-based (cursor = batchId), take default = 10.
- Final exams are module-scoped and can be note-less; only exams can be note-less.
- Final exam questions are generated from user-selected module notes; new notes default to not included.
- If no notes are selected for exam, UI blocks with a dialog offering “Include all notes”.
- Statistics stays on one route with tabs (Practice / Exams).
- Category breakdown defaults to module category; quiz-category filters apply to practice only.
- Module creation category is optional; if omitted, backend generates a default AI category.

## ✅ Process (per feature)

Before each commit/push:
- Update [worklog.md](worklog.md) (STRICT format)
- Update [status.md](status.md) (move items across sections)
- Add/update tests if feasible

## 📋 To Do (V2 Alpha)

### Epic A — Categories (modules + quizzes)

- [x] Backend: add category history tables (batches + items)
- [x] Backend: persist `AI` history batch on `POST .../categories/suggest`
- [x] Backend: persist `Applied` history batch on `PUT .../category`
- [x] Backend: add history endpoints (cursor=batchId, take=10)
- [x] Backend: enforce eligibility gating
	- module: `noteCount + quizCount >= 1`
	- quiz: `questionCount >= 3`
- [x] Backend: expose `questionCount` on quiz detail DTO
- [x] Frontend: wire module/quiz category suggest/apply/history services
- [x] Frontend: category input opens scrollable history on focus (soft dedupe display)
- [x] Frontend: show/edit categories on module cards + module detail + quiz cards + quiz detail

### Epic B — includeExams toggle

- [x] Frontend: add persisted includeExams toggle (localStorage)
- [x] Frontend: pass includeExams to all analytics calls + review queue

### Epic C — Category breakdown analytics

- [x] Backend: add combined category breakdown endpoint (modules + quizzes)
- [x] Frontend: add “Category Breakdown” card on Statistics page (default by attempts)

### Epic D — Bugfix sprint (selected)

- [x] Move Quizzes section above Module Stats (module detail)
- [x] Regenerate exam button disabled unless module has content
- [x] Module cards show labeled counts (Documents/Notes/Quizzes & Exams)
- [x] Quiz cards: click card navigates to quiz detail; remove “View Details” button
- [x] Quiz routing: back from quiz detail returns to the correct module
- [x] Result/review UX: score colors, review accordion hidden by default, retake redirects to quiz detail
- [x] Notes UX: scrollable content, image thumbnails + modal, correct “AI generated” labeling
- [x] Notes actions: generate quiz, delete documents, extract content
- [x] Rename “Extract text” → “Extract content”
- [x] Rename Pending to “Quizzes & Exams”

### Epic E — Final Exam v2 (module-scoped, note-less, selected notes)

- [x] Backend: add `IncludeInFinalExam` on Note (default false)
- [x] Backend: allow final exam quizzes/pending quizzes to be note-less (exams only)
- [x] Backend: final exam generation uses selected module notes as the source
- [x] Backend: regenerate returns `FinalExam.NoNotesSelected` when zero notes selected
- [x] Backend: add bulk “Include all notes for exam” endpoint
- [x] Frontend: add “Include in Final Exam” toggle to module notes list
- [x] Frontend: add “Include in Final Exam” toggle to note detail page
- [x] Frontend: show friendly dialog on `FinalExam.NoNotesSelected` with “Include all notes” + retry

### Epic F — Statistics v2 (tabs + filters)

- [x] Frontend: split Statistics into tabs (Practice / Exams)
- [x] Backend: extend category breakdown to default group by module category
- [x] Frontend: add multi-select quiz-category filters (Practice only)
- [x] Backend: add exam-only analytics endpoint(s) for Exams tab (grouped by module category)

### Epic G — Module create category defaults

- [x] Frontend: module create dialog includes optional category input + helper text
- [x] Backend: module create accepts category; if omitted, AI generates default category
- [x] Backend/UX: avoid “Uncategorized” in normal create flow

### Epic H — UX polish

- [x] Frontend: module detail quiz tab label is “Quizzes & Exams”
- [x] Frontend: quiz detail Back navigates to module detail “Quizzes & Exams” tab
- [x] Frontend: remove quiz accordions/collapsibles (prefer flat sections)

## 🗂️ Done Archive (pre-V2 Alpha)

The previous status board contained a very large historical “Done” ledger (Jan 2026 stabilization + v2 pipeline buildout).
It has been intentionally removed here to keep the V2 Alpha board readable; use git history/blame to retrieve it.
